A variety of public facing social websites process input texts from users in order to display it in public. These websites usually utilize a profanity filtering service in order to avoid exposing the public from extremely obscene phrases . Unfortunately, most of the filtering packages only have support for a few languages. [Amharic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amharic), the official language of Ethiopia with more than 20 million speakers worldwide, has not been one of the supported languages. At least not until `obscenity-filter`.
